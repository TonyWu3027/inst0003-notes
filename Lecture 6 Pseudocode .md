# Lecture 6: Pseudocode - 11/11/19

## Learning Outcomes

-   Algorithms
-   Flow Charts
-   Pseudocode
-   BPMN -> Algorithms -> Pseudocode

## Pseudocode

>   Pseudocode is a step-by-step written outline of your code that you can gradually transcribe into a programming language

## Algorithm

>   Algorithm is a process, or set of rules and tasks, to be followed by to solve a problem

## Procedure

>   Procedure is an established or official way of doing something, the steps to be taken to make somethingh happen or to get something  done

## Flow Chart

>   Flow Chart is a step-by-step graphical representation of a sequence of activities of an algorithm that you can gradually transcribe into a programming language
