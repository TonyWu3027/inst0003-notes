#   Lecture 1: Introduction to Information System - 30/09/19

## *Learning Objectives*

-   Define what is an information system

-   Identify its major components

-   Describe the basic history of IS and data management

-   Have an understanding of why they matters in business oganisations

## Why does Information System matter?

> The **Digital Revolution** refers to the *advancement of technology from analogue electronic and mechanical devices to the **digital** technology available today*

The **Digital Revolution** also marks the beginning of the **Information Era**

> In the 21st century the current period is characterised by the rapid shift from ***traditional industry*** that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialisation, to an ***economy based on information technology***

## Connected World and New Problems

1. **Paralysis through Analysis**

- ***ubiquitous information***, there is always more out there
- Information gathering is ***easy***, and often quite enjoyable as well
- Many corporate decisions are ***delayed*** because of the need for further analysis (whether due to the complexity of the decision, or because of the ***fear*** of not performing sufficient data analysis)

2. **Easy access to data makes us intellectually lazy**

   - Firms invested a lot of money in “big data” and sophisticated data-crunching techniques

   - A data-driven approach :

     - *‘The bigger the database, the easier it is to find support for*

       *any hypothesis’*  (not always true)

     - ‘*Big data makes us lazy*’ rapid processing power is not

       the substitute for thinking and judgment, we still need to use rational model based around deep understanding, experience and intuition

     - *Social media memory* (effect in psychology)

3. **Impulsive and Flighty Consumers**

   - Smartphone, tablets and laptops... ***ubiquitous & multitasking***

   - The ***capacity*** to focus and concentrate on a specific activity is

     falling.

   - It also has massive consequences for how firms manage their consumer relationships, and our work-personal life separation

4. **A little learning is a dangerous thing**

   - We are quick to access information that helps us, but we often lack the ability to make sense of it, or to use it appropriately

   - e.g. Doctors encounter this problem on a daily basis, aspatients show up with (often incorrect) self-diagnoses

## What is Information System?

### Definitions

**Information System (IS)** is:

> the study of ***complementary networks*** of hardware and software that people and organizations use to ***collect, filter, process, create, and distribute data***
>

and

> the ***combinations of hardware, software, and telecommunications networks*** that people build and use to ***collect, create, and distribute*** useful data, typically in organizational settings.
>
> [I*nformation Systems Today - Managing in the Digital World*, fourth edition. Prentice-Hall, 2010 ]

and

> ***interrelated components*** working together to ***collect, process, store, and disseminate*** information to support ***decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization*** in an organization.
>

### Elements

1. **Technology:**

   Address the tools and techonologies used to ***communicate and make the work efficient***

2. **People:**
   Bring ***knowledge, skills and process competencies*** across the workforce to deliver results

3. **Process:**

   Address the ***business needs and workforce, and competencies*** required to meet the requirements

4. **Organisation Culture:**

   An ***environment*** in which process, technology and tools are utilised

## ***Note that:***

- Data is not an answer on its own
- We should be able to build a capacity to extract value from it
- We need to use ***rational model*** based around ***deep understanding, experience and intuition***

## Brief History of Information System in an Organisation

### Mainframes Era - 1950s~1960s

- Hardware: big and bulky mainframes
- Software and data entry: punch cards
- Funtcion: data processing
- User: specialised personnel

### PC Revolution - 1970s~1980s

- Hardware: smaller and personal
- Software and data entry: entered with keyboards and mouse
- Funtcion: data processing & entertainment, typewriter (Word & Excel precursor software)
- Data storage: hard disk and floppy disks
- User: specialised personnel & normal end users

### Client - Server Systems - Mid-1980s

- A computing system composed of two logical parts:
  - a ***server***, which provides information or services
  - a ***client***, which requests then
- Software companies began developing applications

### Current Trends - Now

- End-user hardware is more ubiquitous (e.g. phone, tablets, PC, smart objects)
- Data on the cloud
- Pervasive access to data storage (e.g. WAP connectivity anywhere)

### Extension: Cloud Computing - 1990-2000s

- Users accessing software, computing power and files over the Web instead of on their desktops

## The role of Information System in an organisation

| Hierarchy in a Business Organisation                         | Information System Used             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ***Strategic Management***<br />Executies/ Directors         | Decision Support System (DSS)       |
| ***Tactical Management***<br />Business Unit Managers/ Self-directed Teams | Management Information System (MIS) |
| ***Operational Management***<br />Operations Managers/ Self-directed Teams | Transaction Processing System (TPS) |

## Types of Information System in a Business Organisation

### Management Information System (MIS)

> is a set of ***systems and procedures*** that gather data from a range of resources, compile and present it in a readable format

#### Functions

- **Decision Making**
  - The main purpose of a MIS is to make manger’s decision more efficient and productive
  - A MIS pulls information from a range of sources into a single DB and presents the information in a logical format
  - A MIS can provide managers with everything they need to make highly informed decisions and perform in depth analysis of operational issue
- **Collecting Information**
  - A MIS can be developed to collect nearly any type of information manager require (e.g. financial data)
  - Performance indicators (e.g. quality of a product) can help manager pinpoint areas of needed improvement
  - Staff can manage schedules for work shifts, incoming deliveries and outgoing shipments from any place linked to the MIS
  - A MIS can facilitate collaborations and communication as well
  -  Employers can edit and share documents and communicate relevant information on anticipated developments and warning across the organization
- **Compiling Reports**
  - An MIS can pull data to compile report form internal and external data and a variety of sources
  - Internal reports present information in a way manager can understand grouping data in a logical manner
- **Front-Line Benefits**
  -  Front-line employees can use a MIS to perform their jobs more effectively (e.g. they can check the inventory, view the stats in their department, or request internal transfer of material)
- **Compiling data**
  -  Customised hardware and software, and  IT specialist to  and maintain the system
  -  A company must train all employee on how to use the system
  -  If employee have to perform a front-line activities without the system this might increase the hours of work, thus the cost of a MIS has to be considered in the light of the saving of human effort

#### Application

- Small-business managers rely on a industry-specific management information systems to get current and historical operational performance data (e.g. inventories data)
- The MIS can create reports periodically that the company Management uses tin strategical tactical and operational planning (e.g. sales volume in a territory)
- The small-business manager can also pose queries to the system and ad-hoc analysis of the data

### Decision Support Systems (DSS)

> An interactive information system that assist a decision maker in apporaching ill-structured problems by offering analytical models and access to databases

#### Application

- These allow a small-business manager to use pre-defined and ad-hoc reports to support operational planning and problem-resolution decisions
- With DSS the users find answers to specific questions and a means to evaluate the possible impact of a decision before it is implements
- The answers to queries may take the form of data summary reports (e.g. quarter sales report)
- To conduct an analysis the managers use an interface to select a particular geographical representation of a key performance indicator that measure the progress towards meeting a specific goal

### Transaction Prcoessing System (**TPS**)

> A transaction processing system is a software system, or software/hardware combination, that supports transaction processing

Examples include **systems** that *manage sales order entry, airline reservations, payroll, employee records, manufacturing, and shipping*

- **System runtime functions**
  - Transaction processing systems provide an execution environment that ensures the integrity, availability, and security of data.
  - They also ensure fast response time and high transaction throughput
- **System administration functions**
  - Transaction processing systems provide administrative support that lets users configure, monitor, and manage their transaction systems
- **Application development functions**
  - Transaction processing systems provide functions for use in custom business applications, including functions to access data, to perform intercomputer communications, and to design and manage the user interface.

#### Application

- A small business processes the transactions that result form a day-to-day business operations (e.g. order)
- A TPS requires the users to interact in real time to store retrieve and modify data
- A user enters the transaction data in a terminal (or app) and the system stores it in a database and produces the required output
- For example: debit and credits are directly stored in the Company Bank Account and it is possible to see the balance at any point.
